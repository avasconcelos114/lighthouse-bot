## Hackathon Proposal
### **Summary**
This project seeks to provide added value to the Mattermost ecosystem by adding performance auditing of websites with Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), offering a testing environment that is accessible directly from any Mattermost channel.

### **Problem Statement**
* Website auditing is an often overlooked part of front-end development because of how difficult it is to integrate it to the developers' daily workflow
* Even when periodically used, auditing with Lighthouse can prove to be unreliable* when running on the client-side** because:
  * The internet speed on a given client can vary, causing significant variations in the following metrics:
    * [Time to interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive)
    * [First Contentful Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-contentful-paint)
    * [First Meaningful Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint)
  * Processes running in the background of a computer can have on impact on the results with regards to performance
* It's difficult to share the results of a performance audit with the rest of the team
* There's no current way to track performance over time

\* Performance tests are most reliable when minimizing the number of variables impacting their results  
\*\* Tests ran either through the Chrome developer tools' `audit` tab, or through the Lighthouse plugin on a browser

<!-- Post-hackathon ideas:
  * Ephemeral mode: Runs backend service through a single container (no data store), only supporting a limited (and simpler) set of features -->


### **Use Cases**
<!-- TODO add image of returned message -->
* The development team uses a `/lighthouse https://siteurl.com` command to quickly run an audit of their website's performance, and have the results shared in Mattermost for all the team to see.
  * A brief overview is displayed in-channel, with a link provided to a HTML template that displays the results of a given audit
<!-- TODO Add image of how an HTML template would look like -->
* Running the `/lighthouse stats https://siteurl.com` to view the changes in performance over time as a chart
<!-- TODO show image of performance score in chart, from a Mattermost channel -->
* Scheduling audit tasks for various sites that display the latest values, and the performance trend over time for a given site using `/lighthouse schedule` command and selecting options in a returned dialog

### **Approach**
<!-- TODO: Create a diagram that shows each component interacting with each other -->
